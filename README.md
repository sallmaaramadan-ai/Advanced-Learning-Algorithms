# Advanced-Learning-Algorithms
# Advanced Learning Algorithms – Andrew Ng

This repository contains my implementations and experiments
for the Advanced Learning Algorithms course.

## What I focused on
- Understanding neural networks from scratch
- Implementing models using TensorFlow
- Experimenting with architectures and hyperparameters
- Analyzing bias vs variance and generalization

## Tools
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Notes
All notebooks were written and modified by me
with additional experiments beyond the original labs.
